He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come. 16:14 He will bring glory to me by taking from what is mine and making it known to you. 16:15 All that belongs to the Father is mine.

                        11:11 "Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead?
                        11:12 Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?
                        11:13 If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!"</p>

                    <p>1 John 1:9-2:2 "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. 1:10 If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word has no place in our lives. 2:1 My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense - Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. 2:2 He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world." </p>
